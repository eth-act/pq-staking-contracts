# pq-staking-contracts

Staking and registration contracts for pq validators and builders.

| Directory | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| [`contracts/`](contracts/) | Foundry project: contracts, tests, bytecode export. Released bytecode docs live here. |
| [`site/`](site/) | Interactive model: the contract bytecode running in an in-browser EVM, with a simulated consensus layer. Deployed to GitHub Pages from `main`. |
| [`xmss/`](xmss/) | leanXMSS-K (provisional Keccak instance of leanXMSS): spec, Python reference, and the generator for contract test vectors and site demo keys. |

## Releases

Releases are managed by [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) and
cover `contracts/` only: commits that touch only `site/` do not produce a release.

Commits on `main` must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
(`feat:`, `fix:`, `feat!:` …). release-please keeps a release PR open with the next version
and changelog; merging it tags the release (`vX.Y.Z`), after which CI compiles the contracts
and attaches the bytecode assets described in [`contracts/README.md`](contracts/README.md).
